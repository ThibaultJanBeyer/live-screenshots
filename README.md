# Host it on your own server

If you want, you can run the tool on your own system. This is how to do it:

- Assuming you have `git`, `node`, `npm` installed and medium IT/programming knowledge
- Clone this repo & change directory into it
- Run `npm i`
- Run `PORT=80 npm run production` (change the port to whatever port you need)

Now you should be able to access the app.
